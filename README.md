## CA_Electricity_Deepnote
- I've performed an exploratory data analysis of electricity in Canada for this project. There are three CSV-formatted datasets in this project. Between 2005 and 2050, electrical capacity, generation, and interchange. The datasets are downloaded from the website of the Canadian government.

## Electricity capacity & generation  
- Scenario: currunt policies or evolving policies
- Region: All states of canada
- Variable: biomass/geothermal, natrual gas, coal & coke , Wind, solar, hydro/wave/tidel, uranium, wind
- Type : Only one type which is primary fual
- Year : 2005 to 2050
- Value : float values

## Electricity interchange 
- Scenario: currunt policies or evolving policies
- Region: All states of canada
- Variable: Import, export, interprovincial-inflows, interprovincial-outflows,net export,Net Interprovincial Out-Flows 
- Type : Only one type which is primary fual
- Year : 2005 to 2050
- Value : float values

### Performed various SQL and python operations and explore data.
